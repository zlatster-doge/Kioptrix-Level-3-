Situation:
Tasked with assessing and exploiting a vulnerable Linux web server (Kioptrix Level 3) to evaluate exposure to remote code execution (RCE) and database compromise.

Task:
Identify attack vectors, achieve RCE, and extract user account credentials stored in a MySQL database.

Action:  
  - Conducted network discovery and full-port scanning using Netdiscover, Nmap, and Nikto to enumerate services and exposed web applications.  
  - Identified a vulnerable LotusCMS deployment and researched applicable exploits using SearchSploit, Metasploit, and GitHub resources.  
  - Executed a LotusCMS remote code execution exploit to gain command-level access and enumerate application source files.  
  - Extracted MySQL administrative credentials from exposed configuration files and authenticated directly to the database server.  
Result:  
  - Successfully achieved remote code execution and full access to sensitive web application files.  
  - Retrieved administrative and developer account credentials from the MySQL database, demonstrating complete compromise of the application stack.  
  - Highlighted critical security weaknesses in web application configuration, credential handling, and patch management.
